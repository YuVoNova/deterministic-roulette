# Roulette Game Case Study

This project is a case study for Joker Games, prepared by Yusuf MetindoÄŸan. The objective is to develop a 3D deterministic roulette prototype in Unity that demonstrates a modular coding structure designed for ease of maintenance and testing.

## Instructions
The application launches from the InitScene, which functions as a bootstrapper. This scene initializes all the necessary modules and sets up the game environment. Please refer to the images below for detailed instructions on how to interact with the application.


## Unity Registry Packages Used
- ProBuilder
- 2D Sprite Editor

## Development Tools
- **Unity Version:** 2022.3.20f1  
- **IDE:** JetBrains Rider  
- **UI Design:** Figma (for designing UI images and sprites)

## Data Storage
The application stores PlayerData and StatisticsData in:
%AppData%\LocalLow\YusufMetindogan

## Modular Structure
The project is divided into several modules:
- **Roulette Module:** Handles the roulette wheel and ball animation with deterministic outcomes.
- **Betting Module:** Manages bet placement, validation, and payout calculations along with visual chip placement.
- **Player Module:** Manages player data (money balance) and uses JSON for persistence.
- **Statistics Module:** Tracks and displays play history and total balance.
- **Context and Utils:** General purpose modules for constants, shared data, and services.

This modular design was chosen to simplify unit testing using Unity's TestRunner and to ensure a clean separation of concerns.

## Room for Improvement
- **European Roulette Option:**
  Due to the model constraints, American Roulette is not included. This could be implemented with a simple tweak in BetMapping if a more modular model is provided.
- **Sound Effects:**  
  Time constraints prevented integrating sound effects. Future work would include proper audio feedback for spins, bets, and wins.
- **Particle Effects & Lighting:**  
  No particle effects or advanced lighting were implemented due to the focus on structure and modular coding. This could be added to enhance the visual polish.
- **Additional Betting Options:**  
  Further refinement of bet types and validations could be explored.
- **UI Animations:**  
  More sophisticated UI transitions and animations (beyond the basic flicker and oscillation) can be implemented.
- **Unit Testing:**  
  Although the modular structure was designed with testing in mind, time constraints prevented the integration of unit tests. Extensive unit tests and integration tests would improve robustness.
